Description: The package includes the methods to update the Cholesky decompositions of the cross 
             product of the design matrix when adding or removing a variate of obeservations, which 
             is expected to be faster than computing from scratch. It also includes the initial version
             of Bayesian Variable Selection Regression using MCMC combined with the Cholesky undates.
